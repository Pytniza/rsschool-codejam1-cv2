            <h3><a name="My"></a>About me</h3> <hr />
            <p>I am a novice programmer. 
                I like it because programming as an art. 
                I write code like an artist is writing his picture 
                Each stroke affects the overall look of the picture. 
                And only a special combination of many characters will make 
                an ordinary program a masterpiece. <br>
                I am going to get a lot of experience at RS School and a lot of new acquaintances.
                And also I want to get a job.</p>
